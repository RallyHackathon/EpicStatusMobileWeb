# Epic Status Mobile Web Application #

David Granger from NetApp paired with Larry Maccherone from Rally created
this application. It is designed to run on a smartphone browser. It shows
the current status of an Epic (RED/GREEN/YELLOW) using the same algorithm
as Rally Portfolio Manager but it:

 - Works for Epics
 - Allows a Release to be used as both a filter and to provide the boundaries for the timeframe
 - Runs well in a mobile browser. You never know when your boss will ask about project status
 - (most importantly) Shows the path that you took to get to your current status including scope
   changes and your most recent progress
